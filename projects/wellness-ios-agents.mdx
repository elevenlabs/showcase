# Wellness iOS Agents

## What is it about?

Demo app showcasing AI voice agents in a wellness context. Instead of typing or navigating dashboards, users simply speak to log meals, analyze sleep data, or access insights. The agents generate UI on the fly and work directly with existing data, showing how natural voice input can replace manual entry and make app experience way better.

## How It Works

When I was building this demo I treated it as production ready module, so developer need 4 steps to add new agent and start using it's tools and guardrails

**These steps**

1. Create an agent, configure guardrails, choose voice and connect tools which this agent can use
2. In demo project add created agent id and give it some fun name and related colors
3. Configure methods which will handle tool results following existing template
4. Create UI for a tool result - in single file
