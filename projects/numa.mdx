# Numa

## Overview

Numa is a full-stack React Native project showcasing **ElevenLabs AI Agents** integration with modern mobile development. It demonstrates how to build a real-world speech-to-speech AI app with ElevenLabs' conversational AI technology.

Numa provides developers with hands-on experience combining ElevenLabs' powerful voice AI capabilities with modern mobile frameworks, showcasing protected routes, token management, animated UI, and persistent user sessions.

## Key Features

- **ElevenLabs AI Agents**: Advanced conversational AI with natural speech-to-speech interactions
- **Voice-First Interface**: Seamless voice conversations powered by ElevenLabs technology
- **Speech Processing**: Real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech using ElevenLabs APIs
- **Secure Authentication**: Protected routes with Clerk integration
- **Cross-Platform**: Native React Native performance on iOS and Android
- **Persistent Sessions**: User conversations and AI interactions maintained across app launches
- **Animated UI**: Smooth, responsive interface with modern design patterns

## How It Works

Numa leverages **ElevenLabs AI Agents** to create intelligent voice interactions within a React Native mobile application. The app demonstrates:

1. **Voice Input Processing**: Users speak directly to the app, with audio captured and processed through ElevenLabs' speech-to-text capabilities
2. **AI Agent Conversations**: ElevenLabs AI Agents process the user's intent and generate contextually appropriate responses
3. **Natural Voice Output**: Responses are converted to speech using ElevenLabs' advanced text-to-speech technology
4. **Session Management**: Conversation context is maintained throughout the user session
5. **Real-time Interactions**: Immediate response handling for fluid conversational experiences

The architecture showcases how to integrate ElevenLabs' AI Agent technology with mobile app authentication, navigation, and data persistence patterns.

## Technologies Used
