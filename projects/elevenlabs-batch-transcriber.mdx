# ElevenLabs Batch Transcriber

## Overview

Transcribe entire folders of audio automatically with elevenlabs' state-of-the-art speech-to-text service. Utilize 12.5x more audio transcribed compared to elevenlabs.io web UI. Triple text outputs from all files.

## Key Features

- Automate Tedious Work: Process entire folders instead of one file at a time.
- Save Lotsa Money: Process 12.5x more audio than you normally could via the web UI.
- Triple Useful Results: Every processed file will give a TXT, SRT and JSON files, covering all needs in one go.
- For Laypersons: Made as easy to use with a clear and guided User Interface.

## How It Works

This user friendly downloadable windows desktop program taps into Elevenlabs' state-of-the-art Scribe v1 Speech-To-Text model, transcribing spoken audio/video files into useful text formats for later use with archiving, translation, AI context use, video subtitles or a word-by-word analysis of each granular moment from the speech.

I programmed this in Python and used the ttkbootstrap UI library to create a layperson friendly, guided program that lets anyone without advanced technical skills to get the job done of transcribing entire folders of audio or video with a single click.

The biggest challenges was getting the 3 output files to be formatted and structured by the program in such a way that delivers a useful, clean result. Especially the SRT output files needed additional algorithms to ensure they are timed and section in a way as one would expect from you typical TV show subtitles.

For reference, this ElevenLabs Batch Transcriber program creates 3 files per each audio/video file:
- TXT: for humans and LLMs to read comfortably.
- SRT: for video subtitles that you can load into VLC media player or anything else you use.
- JSON: for technical breakdowns of the speech.
